##Day 1 – A Spiritual Start & Warm Welcomes

#Date: 30 August 2025
The college gates opened to a new chapter in my life, and the first page began with a calm melody—Shabad Kirtan at Guru Sahib. The morning sunlight filtered through, and the chants felt like a blessing for the road ahead.

Tea cups clinked at the welcome gathering, laughter filled the air, and strangers began turning into friends. The inaugural ceremony followed—Tarnveer Kaur as the graceful host, Harsimran Ma’am sharing the college’s proud history, and the chief guest, Mahesh Inder Singh, speaking from the heart about memories and connections.

#Takeaway: “New beginnings feel less scary when the first thing you hear is kindness.”



##Day 2 – Values, Opportunities & Tests of the Mind

#Date: 1 August 2025
The morning unfolded with Dr. Priya Darshani planting seeds of Universal Human Values—reminding us that happiness comes from within, not just from possessions.
A surprise arrived in the form of the Satya Scholarship presentation, opening doors for future opportunities.

Then, Dr. Arvind Dhingra lit up the stage with motivation before we faced our first academic challenge—English & Maths tests. Nervous laughter, quick scribbles, and the first taste of exam tension in college.

#Takeaway: “College isn’t just about learning—it’s about testing who you are becoming.”


##Day 3 – Clubs, Code & Conversations

#Date: 4 August 2025
The Causmic Club welcomed us with creativity—introducing us to GitHub and the world of projects. Dr. Priya Darshani returned, diving deeper into Human Resource Values.

The afternoon brought English with Prof. Nisha, where introductions turned into smiles and grammar lessons into confidence boosters. The day wrapped with a Peer-to-Peer C++ session—our first hands-on taste of coding.

#Takeaway: “In college, your seniors aren’t just above you—they pull you up.”.  


##Day 4 – A Twist in the Timetable

#Date: 5 August 2025
Plans changed last minute, and we found ourselves in branch-specific classrooms, sharing stories with seniors. They revealed the exciting world of campus clubs and future events.

The spotlight then turned to Mrs. Shaffy Makkar, who made millets sound like the superheroes of nutrition. Her lively talk made even the shy ones speak up.

#Takeaway: “Sometimes a change in plan leads to the most memorable lessons.”



##Day 5 – Fitness, Festivals & First Physics

#Date: 6 August 2025
From Dr. Parminder Singh’s tour through clubs and youth fests, to Mr. Manpreet Singh’s interactive session on fitness for engineers, the morning was buzzing.

The afternoon belonged to Physics with Prof. Jaspreet Singh, introducing electromagnetism, and another P2P C++ session that made coding feel less like magic and more like skill.

#Takeaway: “A healthy mind starts with a healthy body—and a curious one starts with questions.”



##Day 6 – Equations, Opportunities & Service

#Date: 7 August 2025
We tackled partial differentiation in Physics and stepped into differential equations in Maths with Prof. Sandeep Kaur Gill. The surprises came in the auditorium—free premium courses, even from IITs, courtesy of Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana.

The final act was from Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, championing the National Service Scheme. The day ended in laughter thanks to a comedy performance.

#Takeaway: “Growth is about balancing knowledge, skills, and kindness.”



##Day 7 – Foundry Workshop

#Date: 8 August 2025
Today we had our first foundry workshop. We learned how metal parts are made. The teacher explained about patterns, moulds, and different types of sand.

We saw how molten metal is poured into a mould and cools into shape. We touched the sand, saw the process, and understood how careful work is needed.

The day was long but interesting because it was more practical than theory.

#Takeaway: “Every metal part starts its journey in a mould.”



##Day 8 – Posters, Photons & Practice

#Date: 11 August 2025
Seniors turned designers today, teaching us the art of poster making—colors, layouts, and visual appeal. Physics followed with lasers, blending theory with imagination. We wrapped up by returning to welding practice.

#Takeaway: “Creativity and science share the same spark—it’s curiosity.”



##Day 9 – IDs, Lasers & First Code

#Date: 12 August 2025
Making our student ID cards felt official—like we’d truly arrived. Physics laser experiments made the theory shine brighter, and our first PPS programming class introduced us to the language of computers.

#Takeaway: “Every student ID is a ticket—not just to classes, but to possibilities.”
